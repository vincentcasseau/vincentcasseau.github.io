The <i>hyStrath</i> GitHub repository is featuring hypersonic and rarefied gas dynamics code developments released under license GPL-3.0. It is the only platform to conjointly host open-source CFD and DSMC codes designed for atmospheric entry analysis.   
Implementation of the OpenFOAM CFD solvers <i>hyFoam</i> and <i>hy2Foam</i> was initiated in 2014 at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK, and was funded by the <a href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</a> (EPSRC) until early 2017. A modified version of the <i>dsmcFoam+</i> code was added end of 2017 as part of a European Space Agency project and was funded by <a href="http://www.fluidgravity.co.uk/fgewebsite/">Fluid Gravity Engineering</a>.  
</p>

<p>.
How-tos and a series of tutorials of increasing complexity can also be found on <i>hyStrath</i>. The platform is meant to be collaborative: if you would like to <a href="https://vincentcasseau.github.io/contributions/">contribute</a>, use it for educational purposes or need support in the form of consulting services, then please <a href="https://vincentcasseau.github.io/people-and-contact/#Contact">get in touch</a>.
