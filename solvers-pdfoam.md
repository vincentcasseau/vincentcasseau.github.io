_pdFoam_ is a hybrid electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) â€” direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code for near-Earth plasma-body interactions. Understanding the interaction of the near-Earth space environment with orbiting bodies is critical, both from a design and scientific perspective. In low-Earth orbit (LEO), the interaction between the ionosphere and orbiting objects is well studied from a charging perspective. Not well understood is the effect of the ionosphere on the motion of LEO objects, _i.e._, ionospheric aerodynamics. _pdFoam_ is the self-consistent modelling tool to take up these challenges.
