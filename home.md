#### The _hyStrath_ GitHub repository is featuring hypersonic and rarefied gas dynamics code developments released under license GPL-3.0. It is the only platform to conjointly host open-source CFD and DSMC codes designed for atmospheric entry analysis.   
Implementation of the OpenFOAM CFD solvers _hyFoam_ and _hy2Foam_ was initiated in 2014 at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK, and was funded by the [Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/) (EPSRC) until early 2017. A modified version of the _dsmcFoam+_ code was added end of 2017 as part of a European Space Agency project and was funded by [Fluid Gravity Engineering](http://www.fluidgravity.co.uk/fgewebsite/).

[CFD how-tos](https://github.com/vincentcasseau/hyStrath/wiki/CFD:-How-to) and a [collection of tutorials](https://github.com/vincentcasseau/hyStrath/wiki/User-tutorials) of increasing complexity can also be found on _hyStrath_. The platform is meant to be collaborative: if you would like to [contribute](https://vincentcasseau.github.io/contributions/), use it for educational purposes or need support in the form of consulting services, then please get in touch.
