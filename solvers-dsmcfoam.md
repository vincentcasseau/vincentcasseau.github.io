A modified version of the <i>dsmcFoam+</i> direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solver was added end of 2017 as part of a European Space Agency project. The original <i>dsmcFoam+</i> code is available at [MicroNanoFlows/OpenFOAM-2.4.0-MNF/tree/devel-craig](https://github.com/MicroNanoFlows/OpenFOAM-2.4.0-MNF/tree/devel-craig). The new features are as follows

* improved load balancing feature
* improved axially-symmetric capability
* inclusion of several variants for vibrational energy redistribution including a constant vibrational collision number
* corrections made to the calculation of macroscopic properties
* re-arranged wall boundary conditions and addition of the absorption & adsorption/desorption mechanisms
* measurement of the mean squared displacement (thus effective diffusivity) and particle transit time for porous media computations
* complete re-arrangement of the QK reaction classes
* added capability to run steady normal shock wave computations
* layer functions for the strongly-coupled hybrid CFD-DSMC code _hyperFoam_
* Ongoing developments
  + adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)  
  + variable time-step method
  + modelling of free-electrons
  + extension of the QK reaction classes to Martian entry problems
