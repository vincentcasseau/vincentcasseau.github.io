_hyFoam_ is an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
solver that derives from _hy2Foam_. In the latter code, the trans-rotational and vibro-electronic energy modes are considered to be in thermal equilibrium, thus producing a single-temperature CFD solver. _hyFoam_ has the capability to model the high-speed chemically-reacting environment inside a scramjet. Most of _hy2Foam_ features remain accessible and _hyFoam_ further receives the addition of

* customizable chemistry databases (Evans & Schexnayder 1980, Jachimowski 1992)
* hydrogen compounds added to the thermochemical database
* transport models: CEA2 (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications, NASA)
