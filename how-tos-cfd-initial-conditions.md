These how-tos are based on the working folder located [here](https://github.com/vincentcasseau/hyStrath/tree/master/run/hyStrath/hy2Foam/genericCase).  

# Initial conditions: the 0/ folder

---  
## 1) The include/ sub-folder

A call to a dictionary in the <dirname>0/include/</dirname> sub-folder can be made to avoid editing multiple files in the <dirname>0/</dirname> directory, in particular if the gas mixture is composed of many species. <dictval>empty</dictval>, <dictval>cyclic</dictval>, <dictval>wedge</dictval>, <dictval>zeroGradient</dictval>, and <dictval>symmetry</dictval> boundary patches can be put into <dirname>include/</dirname><dict>boundaries</dict>. For instance, most fields in the <dirname>0/</dirname> folder require a <dictval>zeroGradient</dictval> outlet boundary condition (BC) and this patch can thus be replaced by a call to <dict>boundaries</dict>.

```c++
boundaryField
{ 
    [...]

    #include "include/boundaries"
}
```

In <dirname>include/</dirname><dict>boundaries</dict>  
```c++
outlet
{
    type            zeroGradient;
}
```

It is good practice to regroup the initial conditions into a single dictionary
as shown later in [ยง 3.1](https://vincentcasseau.github.io/how-tos-cfd-initial-conditions/#31-trans-rotational-temperature) using a call to the <dirname>include/</dirname><dict>initialConditions</dict> dictionary and the symbol _**$**_.

The include statement can be placed at the top of file  

```c++
FoamFile
{
    version     2.0;
    format      ascii;
    class       volVectorField;
    object      U;
}
// * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * //

#include "include/initialConditions"

dimensions      [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0];

internalField   uniform $velocityField;

boundaryField
{
    [...]
}
```

In <dirname>include/</dirname><dict>initialConditions</dict>

```c++
Ttr       300;
Tve       $Ttr;
TveAtom   0;
Twall     810;

pressure  5.18655;

UxInlet 1.131e4;
velocityInlet  ($UxInlet 0 0);
velocityField  (0 0 0);
velocityWall   (0 0 0);

Y_N2      0.767;
Y_O2      0.233;
Y_NO      0;
Y_N       0;
Y_O       0;
```

> This makes running parameterized simulations easier using a bash/python script that will solely edit the <dirname>0/include/</dirname><dict>initialConditions</dict> dictionary entries.

## 2) Species mass fractions
  
Within the <dirname>0/</dirname> folder should be specified all mass fractions of species appearing in the [_**species()**_ list](https://vincentcasseau.github.io/how-tos-cfd-chemistry/#12-addingdeleting-species) located in the <dirname>constant/</dirname><dict>hTCReactions#name</dict> dictionary.  
  
Naming convention for mass-fraction in OpenFOAM avoids the prefix _Y\__, which means the mass-fraction of _N2_ is simply called _**N2**_.  

### 2.1 Non-catalytic wall
+ For a non-catalytic wall, a <dictval>zeroGradient</dictval> BC can be used  

```c++
    wall
    {
        type            zeroGradient;
    }
```

&nbsp;

### 2.2 Super-catalytic wall
For a super-catalytic wall, the mixture composition at the wall is that of the free-stream and the current implementation is as follows
  
```c++
    inlet
    {
        type            fixedValue;
        value           uniform $Y_#speciesName;
    }

    wall
    {
        type            fixedValue;
        value           uniform $Y_#speciesName;
    }
```

<br>

## 3) Temperature fields

### 3.1 Trans-rotational temperature
The trans-rotational temperature field is named _**Tt**_  and must be present in the <dirname>0/</dirname> folder.  

Its implementation in the <dirname>0/</dirname> folder is identical to the standard temperature field in OpenFOAM, except for the Smoluchowski temperature jump boundary condition.    

The Smoluchowski temperature jump boundary condition for the trans-rotational counterpart writes as follows

```c++
    wall
    {
        type            nonEqSmoluchowskiJumpT;
        accommodationCoeff 1;
        Twall           uniform $Twall;
        value           $Twall;
    }
```

&nbsp;

### 3.2 Vibro-electronic temperature

#### 3.2.1 Single vibro-electronic energy pool formulation  
Please refer to [D. ยง2.1](https://vincentcasseau.github.io/how-tos-cfd-nonequilibrium/#21-two-temperature-solver-single-vibro-electronic-energy-pool) if you are not familiar with this code feature.  
   
The mixture vibro-electronic temperature field is called _**Tv**_ and must be present in the <dirname>0/</dirname> folder.  

The Smoluchowski temperature jump boundary condition for the mixture vibro-electronic counterpart writes as follows  

```c++
    wall
    {
        type            nonEqSmoluchowskiJumpTvMix;
        accommodationCoeff 1;
        Twall           uniform $Twall;
        value           $Twall;
    }
```

&nbsp;

#### 3.2.2 Multiple vibro-electronic energy pools formulation  
Please refer to [D. ยง2.2](https://vincentcasseau.github.io/how-tos-cfd-nonequilibrium/#22-two-temperature-solver-multiple-vibro-electronic-energy-pools) if you are not familiar with this code feature.
  
The species vibro-electronic temperature fields are called _**Tv\_#speciesName**_. There are as many _**Tv\_#speciesName**_ fields to define in the <dirname>0/</dirname> folder as there are species in the <dictkey>species()</dictkey> list.  

The Smoluchowski temperature jump boundary condition for the species (molecule) vibro-electronic temperature writes as follows

```c++
    wall
    {
        type            nonEqSmoluchowskiJumpTv;
        accommodationCoeff 1;
        Twall           uniform $Twall;
        value           $Twall;
    }
```

<br>

## 4) Velocity field

The Maxwell velocity slip boundary condition has been slightly re-written (the [mean free path](https://vincentcasseau.github.io/how-tos-cfd-nonequilibrium/#3-mean-free-path-and-breakdown-parameter) now depends upon the model retained in <dict>transportProperties</dict> dictionary) and is defined as 

```c++
    wall
    {
        type            nonEqMaxwellSlipU;
        accommodationCoeff 1;
        Uwall           $velocityWall;
        refValue        uniform $velocityWall;
        valueFraction   uniform 1.0;
        thermalCreep    true;
        curvature       true;
        value           uniform $velocityWall;
    }
```

The velocity at the inlet patch can increase linearly with time from an <dictkey>offset</dictkey> value up to a velocity whose components are given by the entry <dictkey>refValue</dictkey>, components that can then be multiplied by the <dictkey>amplitude</dictkey>.
For example, for a linear 1e-4 sec long increase in velocity from 50 m/s up to 1000 m/s with no angle of attack nor slip angle (_**U**_ is thus aligned with the x-axis: (1 0 0)), then the new <dictkey>rampInlet</dictkey> boundary condition is

```c++
    inlet
    {
        type            rampInlet;
        refValue        uniform (1 0 0);
        offset          (50 0 0);
        amplitude       1000;
        tRamp           1e-4;
    }
```

To use the <dictkey>rampInlet</dictkey> boundary condition, a line should be added into the <dirname>system/<dirname><dict>controlDict</dict> dictionary 
 
```c++
libs ("libstrathFiniteVolume.so");
```
